# DataExtendable.Interfaces Library

## Overview

This part of the DataExtendable library contains the interfaces.

DataExtendable is a flexible library designed to support the creation of extendable data classes.
It is particularly useful in systems utilizing a plugin-based architecture, where data can be extended dynamically by
plugins.

The core concept revolves around a DataExtension, which allows developers to extend core data models with
plugin-specific attributes or functionalities.
Each DataExtension is associated with a unique identifier (UID) that corresponds to the plugin responsible for the
extension.

## Key Features

- **Extendable Data Models:** Easily add custom properties or methods to core data models using plugins.
- **Plugin Compatibility:** Supports a plugin-based architecture, where each extension is uniquely identified by the
  plugin’s UID.
- **Flexible Integration:** Can be integrated into any system where extensibility is required, enabling modular and
  scalable application design.

## Use Case

This library is ideal for applications where you need to dynamically extend core data models with new properties or
behavior based on installed plugins.
It ensures that data extensions are properly associated with the plugins that introduce them, allowing for modularity
and improved maintainability in plugin-driven systems.
